### Introddction 
- I am a varsity Ultimate Frisbee player at Sharon High School, and before Ultimate, I played ice hockey, where coaches regularly used tactical boards to teach and execute strategy. In contrast, I have not seen a similar real-time tactical tool used in Ultimate Frisbee. After learning AI and computer vision through summer programs, I realized these tools could fill that gap by tracking players and the frisbee disc in real time. This data-driven e-tactics board would give coaches immediate tactical insight and improve decision-making during games.

Here are some interesting models I have trained / implemented, which runs on a Raspberry Pi 5 computer.
