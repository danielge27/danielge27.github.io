## Introduction 
- I am a varsity Ultimate Frisbee player at Sharon High School, and before Ultimate, I played ice hockey, where coaches regularly used tactical boards to teach strategies and make in-game decisions. In contrast, I have not seen a similar real-time tactical tool used in Ultimate Frisbee. After learning AI and computer vision through a few AI-topiced summer programs, I realized these tools could fill that gap by tracking players and the frisbee disc in real time. This data-driven e-tactics board would give coaches immediate tactical insight and improve decision-making during games.

## Roadmap 

Inspired by Roboflow tutorials on deploying YOLO-based computer vision to track and analyze soccer game footage, I aim to build a similar system tailored specifically for Ultimate Frisbee. Below is the proposed development roadmap, starting with player tracking.
