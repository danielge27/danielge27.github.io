## Ulti-board: Real-Time Ultimate Frisbee Analytics 
Ulti-board is a real-time tactical analytics system for Ultimate Frisbee. 

I am a varsity Ultimate Frisbee player at **Sharon High School**. Before Ultimate, I played ice hockey, where coaches regularly used tactical boards to teach strategies and make in-game decisions. In contrast, I have not seen a similar real-time tactical tool used in Ultimate Frisbee. 

After learning **AI and computer vision** through a few AI-topics summer programs, I realized these tools could fill that gap by tracking players and the frisbee disc in real time. This data-driven e-tactics board would provide coaches with immediate tactical insights and improve decision-making during games.

## Roadmap 

Inspired by Roboflow tutorials on deploying **YOLO-based computer vision** to track and analyze soccer game footage, I aim to build a similar system tailored specifically for Ultimate Frisbee. Below is the proposed development roadmap, starting with player tracking.
