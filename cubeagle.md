# Cubeagle — Build a CubeSat Challenge

We are a team of **four Sharon High School students** [SHS](https://hs.sharonschools.net/en-US), and I serve as the **team captain**.

## About the Challenge
The MIT Beaver Works Summer Institute (BWSI) **Build a CubeSat Challenge** [BACC] (https://bwsi.mit.edu/cubesat-challenge/) is a national, project-based engineering program where high school teams design, build, and test a **1U CubeSat prototype**.

Our work includes:
- Designing CubeSat subsystems
- Building and integrating hardware
- Testing power, communication, and payload systems
- Documenting results and presenting our mission

---


## Mission Snapshot
Our CubeSat prototype is designed to demonstrate successful subsystem integration and data collection for the BWSI mission scenario, with an emphasis on reliability, testing, and clear engineering documentation.


---


## Subsystems
- **Structure** — 1U CubeSat frame
- **Power** — battery and power regulation
- **On-board Computer** — control and data handling
- **Communications** — radio and antenna
- **Payload** — sensor / camera


---


## Hardware Status
✅ Raspberry Pi hardware build complete
✅ Flat Sat Challenge Photo complete

Current focus:
- System bring-up and verification
- Power and communication testing
- Payload data collection
