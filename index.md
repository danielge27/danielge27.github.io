## Hi, I’m Haifeng Ge 

**Rising 11th-grader and USAJMO Qualifier (2025)**  , Passionate about number theory, combinatorics, and computational experiments.

I thrive at the intersection of elegant proofs and hands-on computation, and I’m eager to contribute **8–10 hours/week** this summer to a research project in number theory, combinatorics, or computational mathematics.

**6 mini-research notebooks** • **4 visually engaging blog posts** • **8 competition medals**
