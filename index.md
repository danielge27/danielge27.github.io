## Hi, I’m Daniel Ge 

I am a rising 11th-grader and USAJMO Qualifier, and I'm passionate about mathematics and engineering.

For math, I like the intersection of elegant proofs and hands-on computation. I’m eager to contribute 8–10 hours/week this summer to some math research project with a focus on number theory, combinatorics, or computational mathematics.

In engineering, thanks to several local universities (especially MIT), engagement in local communities, I am inspired by how math can be applied to AI and engineering. I am particular intersted in computer vision applications and Raspberry Pi
