## Hi, I’m Daniel Ge 

I am a rising 11th-grader and USAJMO Qualifier, and I'm passionate about discrete mathematics.

I like the intersection of elegant proofs and hands-on computation, and I’m eager to contribute 8–10 hours/week this summer to a research project in number theory, combinatorics, or computational mathematics.

**6 mini-research notebooks** • **4 visually engaging blog posts** • **8 competition medals**
