**Hi, this is Daniel Ge**

I’m a rising junior at Sharon High School and I love math.  I enjoy the intersection of elegant proofs and hands-on computation, and I’m eager to conduct mathematical research this summer on topics such as (but not limited to) number theory, combinatorics, or computational mathematics. Here are some of my math results!

1. **2025 USAJMO Qualifier**  
2. **2025 American Regions Math League (ARML) Div B: 1st in region, 3rd nationally**
3. **Berkeley Math Tournament: Distinguished Honorable Mention**

Outside of math, I like to play frisbee and explore physics. I also teach chess and participate in various clubs.

Recently, some of my favorite topics have been:

1. **Koch Snowflake**  
   Used Python & Turtle to draw Koch Snowflake at different orders.  
2. **Sierpiński Triangle**  
   Illustrate the concept of the Sierpiński Triangle and its application, with Python code for generating it.
3. **Visualize the Collatz Sequence and Collatz Spiral**  
   Use Python to plot the Collatz Spiral at any given starting number.
4. **Approximating π by Slicing the Circle**
   Illustrate an ancient Mathematician's idea of how to calculate Pi, using the slicing circle approach, and visualize it in Python

See the blog section to view these topics in more depth!

In the near future, I am looking forward to exploring: 
- **Analytic Number Theory** (prime gaps, L-functions)  
- **Algebraic Combinatorics** (generating functions, graph designs)  
- **Computational Conjecture Testing** (data-driven exploration with Python/Sage)  

I’m excited to jump into coding simulations, verifying small-case proofs, or surveying literature under mentorship.
